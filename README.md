# **About**
            
 #### Flux.1-Dev
  FLUX.1 [dev] is a 12 billion parameter rectified flow transformer capable of generating images from text descriptions. FLUX.1 [dev] is an open-weight, guidance-distilled model for non-commercial applications. Directly distilled from FLUX.1 [pro], FLUX.1 [dev] obtains similar quality and prompt adherence capabilities, while being more efficient than a standard model of the same size.

  ### JSONify-Flux
  JSONify-Flux is a multimodal image-text-text model trained on a dataset of FLUX-generated images with context-rich captions based on the Qwen2VL architecture. The JSON-based instruction has been manually removed to avoid JSON format captions.[JSONify-Flux Model](https://huggingface.co/prithivMLmods/JSONify-Flux)
            
  #### t5-Flan-Prompt-Enhance
  t5-Flan-Prompt-Enhance is a prompt summarization model that enriches synthetic FLUX prompts with more detailed descriptions.[t5-Flan-Prompt-Enhance Model](https://huggingface.co/prithivMLmods/t5-Flan-Prompt-Enhance)
